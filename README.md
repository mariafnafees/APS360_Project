# APS360 Project: QuickDraw Image Classification

This project explores the use of deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), for classifying hand-drawn sketches from the [QuickDraw dataset](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset). By utilizing both spatial and sequential features, the aim is to improve recognition accuracy.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop deep learning models that can effectively classify hand-drawn sketches from the QuickDraw dataset. We will focus on exploring various techniques, such as CNNs and RNNs, to capture both the spatial structure and the sequential nature of the drawings.

This GitHub repository will be updated with all relevant resources, model code, scripts, and datasets used throughout the project.

## Project Milestones

### 1. Data Preprocessing
For details on data preprocessing, please refer to the documentation in the following folder:  
[APS360_Project/Data Preprocessing](https://github.com/mariafnafees/APS360_Project/tree/main/Data%20Processing)

### 2. Baseline Model
For details on the baseline model, please refer to the documentation in the following folder:  
[APS360_Project/Baseline](https://github.com/mariafnafees/APS360_Project/tree/main/Baseline)

### 3. Primary Model
We used AlexNet in our primary model. For details on the primary model, please refer to the documentation in the following folder: 
[APS360_Project/Primary Models](https://github.com/mariafnafees/APS360_Project/tree/main/Primary%20Models)

### 4. Final Application
User-friendly flask application, where user draws a sketch and model guesses the sketch from nine categories. For details on the final app, please refer to the documentation in the following folder: [APS360_Project/Sketch n Guess](https://github.com/mariafnafees/APS360_Project/tree/main/Sketch%20n%20Guess)
